In this assignment, I built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset links to an external site, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.  The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

This interactive dashboard visualizes the bacterial biodiversity of belly button samples collected from volunteer participants. Built using JavaScript, D3.js, Plotly.js, and styled with Bootstrap, the app allows users to explore data through dynamic charts and demographic info.
